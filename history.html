        <p class="max-width hidden">Ally Brennan, a specialist teacher, worked at Comberton Village College in 2009 and was always a
            key figure within the extended schools partnership out of which the counselling project grew, Ally was
            enthusiastic and passionate about this work. She passed away in February 2012 and it is in her
            honour that the project has been named allyance.</p>
        <p class="max-width hidden">allyance has been in existence since April 2009 following a consultation with headteachers across 27
            schools in the CABMAG (Comberton, Bassingbourn, Melbourn and Gamlingay) area. The
            overwhelming outcome was the lack of provision to support children experiencing difficult life events.
            These schools decided to pool resources and use Government Funding (Extended Schools) to
            establish an in-school counselling service. This funding came to an end in December 2011. Having
            helped many children and their families, as many schools found this to be an invaluable service it was
            decided that a new working model should be developed. The new model for schools is explained
            elsewhere in the website. (See schools' info).
        </p>
        <p class="max-width hidden">
            During the intervening years allyance has been a constant support for our schools, regardless of the
            national picture.

            found that school, friendships and appearance continue to cause the greatest dissatisfaction in
            adolescence. This year's report focuses on schools as vital settings that influence children's
            wellbeing. The findings show feeling listened to in school was strongly associated with children's
            overall happiness at school.</p>

            Our experience shows us that intervention work at an early stage helps prevent the escalation of
            some of these young people's difficulties and improves their learning outcomes. We have always
            strongly believed that providing experienced, fully qualified counsellors used to working within school
            settings has been our strength.
