                    Following a career as a primary school teacher across a range of settings, I have recently trained as a
                    Play Therapist. I have also completed additional training in developmental trauma. Through both my
                    career and training I have supported children with a wide range of needs including autism, ADHD,
                    anxiety, communication difficulties and trauma. I work with individuals and groups, and communicate
                    with parents, teachers, support staff and senior leaders in schools to support those children.
                    I focus on providing a warm, caring therapeutic environment, I work in a child-led way, using an
                    integrative holistic model of play therapy. I use a range of different media to enable children to
                    express and explore their needs, emotions and situations. I work hard to develop the therapeutic
                    relationship between myself and the child to enable them to feel comfortable and cared for during the
                    sessions.
