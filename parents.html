        <p class="max-width hidden">Play is your child's natural medium of self-expression, essential for enabling them to develop
            physically, emotionally and socially. It helps to develop their imagination and encourages creativity.

            Play offers the opportunity for children to help themselves by 'playing out' feelings and problems.
        </p>
        <p class="max-width hidden">
            During the counselling session, a trusting relationship develops with the therapist, in which children
            begin to feel safe enough to explore their difficulties and learn new ways of relating.
        </p>
        <p class="max-width hidden">
            Many children encounter challenging events and experiences in their early lives, which may lead to
            feelings of stress and anxiety. Children do not yet have the vocabulary or emotional maturity to
            express their feelings or to make sense of them. In the session, they can play out some of these
            anxieties and even find the words for them, or sometimes the process can be non-verbal.
        </p>
        <p class="max-width hidden">
            What happens in a counselling session? The therapist depending on their discipline will have a “tool
            kit” of equipment in the room. Sometimes your child will be guided towards a particular medium, or
            sometimes they will be able to play with what they choose.
        </p>
        <p class="max-width hidden">
            Whatever your child plays with, the therapist creates a safe, non-judgemental and confidential space
            for them during the session which will enable the child to explore their difficult or confusing feelings.
        </p>

        <a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p class="max-width hidden">When a child begins the session, it is key to the effective treatment of the therapy that the child feels
            able to express their thoughts and feelings without feeling judged. A very important part of the therapy
            is the building of trust in the therapeutic relationship and the creation of a “safe space” which exists
            solely for the child and therapist.</p>
        <p class="max-width hidden">Your child must feel safe, comfortable and understood. This type of trusting environment makes it
            easier for your child to express his/her thoughts and feelings and to use the therapy in a useful way.
            Experience shows that the creation of this trusting environment, can improve your child’s relationships
            with others, including friends as well as family.</p>'
        <p class="max-width hidden">At the start of counselling the therapist explains to the child in an age appropriate way the meaning of
            confidentiality. From this your child will understand that they are free to talk to their parents/carers and
            family about what they do in sessions, if they choose to do so. Parents/carers are encouraged to be
            curious and interested whilst being sensitive to how much the child may want to share from their sessions. 
            The therapist will not disclose specific details of what your child has played. This is
            important in order to maintain your child’s trust and feelings of safety with the therapist.</p>
        <p class="max-width hidden">
            There are of course, exceptions to maintaining confidentiality. If your child were to disclose something
            which might put your child or any other child at risk, then the therapist would speak to the
            headteacher and parents/carers.

        <p class="max-width hideen">You are very important in supporting your child through the counselling process and it is crucial that
            your child knows that you are supporting this. Be consistent and encouraging to your child about
            attending the counselling sessions regularly. Try to resist the urge to ask your child what they did in
            the session as this may make them feel pressurised to comment on something they may not yet
            understand themselves.</p>

        <a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p class="max-width hideen">The therapist can talk to you about how well the child is engaging with the therapy and the sorts of
            activities your child is taking part in. You will have the opportunity to discuss any changes or
            developments that you have witnessed or experienced at home. The therapist may also be able to
            talk about some of the themes emerging from the sessions and any changes the therapist may have
            noticed as the therapy progresses</p>
