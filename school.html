        <p class="max-width hidden">allyance is a social enterprise not for profit in-school counselling service. It was originally formed in April
            2009 by schools in the CABMAG (Comberton, Bassingbourn, Melbourn and Gamlingay) area as a
            response to the lack of high-level mental health support for children who were experiencing or had
            experienced difficult life events, particularly those of primary age. The schools agreed to pool funding
            in order to use economies of scale to provide an enhanced and flexible service. With support from the
            Local Authority, latterly in the form of the Dedicated Schools Grant, schools within the allyance
            cluster are able to access high quality counselling at a subsidised rate. Through our network of
            counsellors allyance also provides services for schools outside the cluster to buy into.</p>

        <a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p class="max-width hidden">The allyance clinical team consists of representatives from different therapeutic disciplines and
            includes:</p>
        <li>A Clinical Supervisor</li>
        <li>A Music Therapist</li>
        <li>Play Therapists</li>
        <li>Psychodynamic Counsellors</li>
        <p class="max-width hidden">The therapists are a strong and stable professional team who all share the same vision and
            commitment to allyance. They have a lot of experience of working in primary schools and therefore
            understand the institutional context of working in an education setting, including liaison with relevant
            staff and parents. They can also attend multi-agency meetings where appropriate.</p>

        <a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
        <p class="max-width hidden">All members of the allyance team are accredited by the relevant professional body according to their
            qualifications, e.g. PTUK (Play Therapy United Kingdom), UKCP (UK Council for Psychotherapy),
            BACP (British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy), BAMT (British Association of Music
            Therapy). As a part of their accreditation and membership they receive professional supervision from
            these bodies. This complements the half-termly group allyance-specific sessions run by our clinical
            supervisor which allow them to reflect on current cases.</p>
        <p class="max-width hidden">
            Annual safeguarding / child protection training is delivered by <a href="https://www.safecic.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="inner-p">www.safecic.co.uk</a> who also oversee
            DBS checks. Therapists also receive a set of safeguarding documents to complement this training.
            Allyance schools are also responsible for providing their counsellors relevant specific Child
            Protection / Safeguarding information about their school each September.

        <p class="max-width hidden">
            The running of allyance is overseen by a steering group which includes cluster headteachers. The
            steering group meets termly to discuss finances / accounts, training of counsellors, (anonymised)
            pupils in counselling etc. The steering group also oversee the work of the allyance coordinator, who
            works with the clinical supervisor to deploy the team of counsellors and therapists.</p>
        <h1 class="subheading hidden" id="The allyance model in practice...">The allyance model in practice...</h1>
        <li>Each school pays in a set amount to receive an agreed level of counselling/support. (see
            section below).</li>
        <li>Schools in consultation with therapists decide how to use their allocated time â€“ referrals
            typically come through the Headteacher or SENDCO. Sessions are one hour long, this
            includes face to face client time, report writing and on occasions liaising with school staff.</li>
        <li>Allyance counselling is based on need rather than a fixed number of sessions.</li>
        <li>Sometimes it may be appropriate for a counsellor to meet with the parents before the sessions
            commence.</li>
        <li>Each counsellor will start and end with a strengths and difficulties questionnaire completed by
            child, parents and school. This is then repeated approximately 6 weeks after therapy sessions
            have started to inform discussions about the progress.</li>
        <li>Counsellors will liaise with school staff regarding any potential strategies which might support
            the young person.</li>
        <li>Where appropriate, counsellors will help year 6 students to prepare for transition to secondary
            school. In some cases they may continue to support the young person for a short time after
            they have transferred to Year 7.</li>
